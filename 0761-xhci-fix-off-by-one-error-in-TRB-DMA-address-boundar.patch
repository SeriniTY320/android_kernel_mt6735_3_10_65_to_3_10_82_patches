Subject: [PATCH 0761/1168] xhci: fix off by one error in TRB DMA address
 boundary check
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 7895086afde2a05fa24a0e410d8e6b75ca7c8fdd upstream.

We need to check that a TRB is part of the current segment
before calculating its DMA address.

Previously a ring segment didn't use a full memory page, and every
new ring segment got a new memory page, so the off by one
error in checking the upper bound was never seen.

Now that we use a full memory page, 256 TRBs (4096 bytes), the off by one
didn't catch the case when a TRB was the first element of the next segment.

This is triggered if the virtual memory pages for a ring segment are
next to each in increasing order where the ring buffer wraps around and
causes errors like:

[  106.398223] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD ep_index 0 comp_code 1
[  106.398230] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Looking for event-dma fffd3000 trb-start fffd4fd0 trb-end fffd5000 seg-start fffd4000 seg-end fffd4ff0

The trb-end address is one outside the end-seg address.
